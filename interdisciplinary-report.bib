abstract = {The literature concerning man-computer transactions abounds in controversy about the limits of "system response time" to a user's command or inquiry at a terminal. Two major semantic issues prohibit resolving this controversy. One issue centers around the question of "Response time to what?" The implication is that different human purposes and actions will have different acceptable or useful response times.},
