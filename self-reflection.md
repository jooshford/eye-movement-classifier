# Cultural Competence

Throughout my degree, my **Cultural Competence** has been greatly developed, by continuously engaging in group projects, where group culture and collaboration is crucial for optimal learning.

In SOFT2412, I was in a group with multiple students who struggled with English. This led to poor communication and frustration between students. The other students couldn't complete their work, because because they were struggling to understand the tasks they were assigned. This impacted our relationships, quality of work, and ability to share ideas. To overcome this, I had to understand that their lack of work was due to communication difficulty, not laziness. I moved communications primarily to messaging, which was easier for the foreign students. This allowed communication of each individual's strengths and weaknesses, and better allocation of roles. As a result, work was completed faster, at a higher quality, without frustration. We were able to collaborate, and communicate our different perspectives, which greatly enhanced our learning. Looking back, we should have planned our communication before beginning, and had a more open dialogue regarding issues.

I applied this in the interdisciplinary project, where my group consists of multiple students with whom there is a language barrier. We began by discussing our strengths, weaknesses, and desired roles. We set up a Discord group, where all important conversations were held/recorded. There are still periods of frustration, however I have learned it is important to reflect on others' emotions, and check in on people periodically. As a result, everyone's strengths were capitalised on, and the project is a culmination of the group's diverse ideas and perspectives. There is room for improvement, because I still find it easier in some situations to do things myself, than to put in the extra effort to communicate to all members clearly.

In the future, I can use this skill to effectively plan and communicate, allowing groups that I work in to effectively share interdisciplinary perspectives, so that we can build innovative solutions in a positive, productive environment.
